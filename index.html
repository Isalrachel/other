    <p>St. Jerome in His Study is an oil-on-panel painting by the Italian Renaissance master Antonello da Messina, thought to have been completed around 1460 to 1475 during Antonello's Venetian sojourn. The small picture portrays Saint Jerome working in his studio, a room without walls and ceiling seen from a kind of triumphal arch (probably within some church of Aragonese style). As in several other works by the Messinese painter, the main scene is accompanied by a host of details that have points of contact with the contemporary Flemish school: books, animals and objects painted with a taste for detail and "optical truth". The painting is now in the collection of the National Gallery in London.</p>
